# coin_change_visualizer
See the coin change problem come to life with a visual representation of its recursive tree structure (only using 1-cent and 5-cent coins for better visualization since tree becomes crowded otherwise)

Red leaf nodes represent branches of the tree that failed to make change and green leaf nodes represent the branches that succeeded at making change. Hovering over a green leaf node displays a tooltip that declares the number of 5 cent and 1 cent coins used.
